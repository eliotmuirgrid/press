# Tools

Effective tooling is essential for the robust development and maintenance of Iguana integrations. Below are three critical types of tools that significantly enhance both development efficiency and code reliability.

## Input/Output Tracing Command Line Tool

One of the most crucial needs for Iguana is a command line tool that can run transformations using sample data and record all resulting outputs. These outputs could range from database changes, API calls, to HL7 message generation. By executing transformations in a controlled environment and logging the results, developers can iteratively refactor and simplify code with confidence—always being able to verify that the integration still produces the correct outcomes.

This tool is particularly valuable during development cycles, enabling automated loops that catch unintended side effects or regressions as code evolves.

## Profiling Tool

Building on the Input/Output tracing concept, a profiling tool allows for complete, end-to-end transformation runs while providing detailed insight into function execution. Developers can selectively trace specific functions within the integration flow, helping them identify bottlenecks and areas that may require optimization. This profiling capability is key to ensuring integrations are not only correct, but also efficient—crucial for high-throughput or latency-sensitive applications.

## AI Code Rewrite Tool

A local, sovereign AI tool for methodically simplifying and improving source code.

The tool would follow Eliot’s coding best practices: simplify first, separate concerns, improve naming, clean up indentation, reduce unnecessary complexity, and make the code easier to understand, maintain, and secure.

It would apply one improvement at a time, transparently showing the user what changed and why. Rather than attempting a risky “big bang” rewrite, it would guide the code through a disciplined refactoring workflow: small steps, clear rationale, testable changes, and continuous human oversight.

The goal is not merely prettier code. The goal is code that is simpler, safer, easier to maintain, and easier for customers and consultants to trust.

## Code/Signing Encryption

Eliot will provide a code encryption and signing tool that affiliates can use to protect their own intellectual property when working with clients.

Affiliates should not have to give away valuable reusable integration patterns simply because they are used in a client project. The tool creates a clear boundary between client-owned code and proprietary affiliate code.

The arrangement must be transparent: the client, the affiliate, and Eliot should all understand who owns what and who may read, run, modify, reuse, or redistribute it.

Shared code does not mean unrestricted rights. Access and ownership should reflect the business context.

## Migration Support

These tools are not only vital for developing new integrations under the [affiliate](i.md) model but are also indispensable for clients migrating existing code to newer, more secure versions of Iguana. Comprehensive tracing and profiling ensure code migrations are smooth, robust, and minimize unexpected behavior, ultimately paving the way for a seamless transition to the latest platform features and security enhancements.
